# Machine Learning Project - Sonal data Classification
Prepared by Vishnu Prakash (BCE 114)
___
# Why this activity?
- This activity is a basic Machine learning projects aims to give you an introduction to Machine learning
- This uses libraries like pandas, numpy and scikit which are extensively used for ML problems
- The LogisticRegression algorithm which is used here is one of the simplest and popular classification model in use.
# Problem Statement
A dataset with sonar data is provided. Each row in data consists of feedbacks from sonar machine.
Our aim is to train a model capable of effectively distinguishing between sonar signals reflected from rocks and those reflected from mines. 
# Getting started
1. Create a colab/ipynb file
2. Import the dataset "Sonar_data.csv"
3. Train a model and predict the targets of test data.
4. Evaluate the accuracy
